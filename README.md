# Spark_Flight_Classification


## Description
This notebook performs classification of flight data using Apache Spark ML. It preprocesses flight data, applies feature engineering, trains a Naive Bayes classifier, and evaluates the model's performance.


## Notebook Contents
1. **Importing Spark ML and creating a session** - Setting up the Spark environment.
2. **Loading flight data** - Reading the dataset.
3. **Preprocessing and feature engineering** - Handling missing values and transforming data.
4. **Training a classification model** - Applying Naive Bayes for classification.
5. **Evaluating model performance** - Assessing the accuracy and effectiveness of the classifier.


## Requirements
- **Apache Spark** 
- **Python 3.x**
- **Jupyter Notebook** or a compatible environment


## Installation and Execution
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
